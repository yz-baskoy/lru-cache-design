LRU Cache Implementation in C++ with Hashing

This is a C++ implementation of an LRU Cache using hashing. The cache uses a hash table to store the key-value pairs, and a doubly linked list to keep track of the least recently used items. The cache can store any type of object, but in this implementation, I have used a Person class to demonstrate its usage.
